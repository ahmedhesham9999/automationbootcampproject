# automationbootcampproject 
## Final project in Selenium Automation Bootcamp Batch 3

### . This project contains the flow for reserving an hotel from "MakeMyTrip" website.
### . What I have implemented (it is uncompleted project):
##### 1- Home Page Test case to open the browser
####  2- Search Page Test case to search for hotel , add dates , choose rooms and travel for reason
####  3- Hotel Page Test case to Hotel , apply price  filters , ratings ,click on 5th  Hotel and capture hotel name

## How To run the project
### . Supposed to be from pom.xml but for some reason it's not working with me
### . Project supports Chrome Driver , Firefox and Safari.

## Issues I faced during the project
 ### . The filter part filtering the two areas togteher sometimes doesnt work so I commented one of them also I tried to add wait but was not of help
 ### . Everytime the hotel test case is executed there are different hotels so I was not able to build a logic to add rooms as every time the locator differs so I was not able to        proceed with the flow.
